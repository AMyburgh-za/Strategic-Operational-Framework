# Strategic Operational Framework for a Financial Consultancy

This repository outlines the architectural framework for a comprehensive, multi-phase operational transformation. The objective is to move from a decentralized, manual workflow to a unified, scalable, and data-driven operational system.

**The core philosophy is to systematically engineer "Strength in Vision, Power in Purpose" into the firm's daily operations.**

## The Four-Phase Campaign

This transformation is structured as a four-phase campaign, with each phase building upon the last.

### [Phase 1: Foundational CRM for Individual Clients (In Progress)](.[/Phase-1-Individual-Client-CRM](https://github.com/AMyburgh-za/Phase-1-Individual-Client-CRM))

*   **Status:** In Progress
*   **Objective:** To establish a "single source of truth" by implementing a foundational CRM system for the individual client value stream. This phase focuses on creating immediate efficiency gains and establishing core data integrity.
*   **Deliverable:** A fully implemented CRM using ClickUp and integrating it as far as possible with Google Workspace as well as One Drive where we currently store all our client files, serving as the capstone project for the Google Project Management certification.

### Phase 2: Internal & Practice Management Systems (Planned)

*   **Status:** Planned
*   **Objective:** To analyze and systematize internal firm processes, including compliance workflows, financial reporting, and practice management.
*   **Deliverable:** A defined set of streamlined internal SOPs and their integration into the core operational system.

### Phase 3: Employee Benefits (EB) Framework Integration (Planned)

*   **Status:** Planned
*   **Objective:** To design and integrate the complex workflows of the Employee Benefits division into the unified system, addressing its unique data and client service requirements.
*   **Deliverable:** A scalable EB client management module within the core system.

---

### Phase 4: Unified Bespoke System Architecture (Vision)

*   **Status:** Long-Term Vision
*   **Objective:** Leveraging the data and learnings from Phases 1-3, the final phase involves designing and potentially building a proprietary, first-principles system that perfectly aligns with the firm's unique strategic differentiators.
*   **Deliverable:** A complete architectural blueprint for a next-generation, bespoke operational platform.
